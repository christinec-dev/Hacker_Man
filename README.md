# Hacker_Man
When I think of the game _hangman_, I get really uncomfortable thinking about hanging somebody - even if it is a game! That's why I decided to do my own little twist of the classic hangman game, called Hacker_Man.

With Hacker_Man, you need to guess the correct string of word(s) in order to unlock the secret key - yes it works, and you will be shown some sensitive data upon success! If you don't succeed, instead of hanging someone, you get locked out of the "system" and told to try again. This game was inspired by Watch Dogs and Cyberpunk themes.

In this project, instead of doing all the coding for the game on a singular app.js or index.js page, I broke my source code up into their respective component and layout files. I now have pretty solid understanding of how to call to and create react array objects, and I even learnt how to do more CSS animation techniques! I made the images on my own on pixlr.com. This application is fully functional. You can click on letters to guess the code, or reset the code to a new code at will.

A special thanks to the creators of the AsherPunk-Font, Consola-Font, Hacked-Kerx Fonts, and the background images.

Day four (which took two days!) of trying to code in React on my own was a success. I completed it with the following: React, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, SCSS and Bootstrap.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
